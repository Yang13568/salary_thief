Place your content in `text.txt`, then launch `autoscroll.exe`.

When you first open the program, a window will appear allowing you to draw and adjust its size and position as desired.  
After closing the window, the program will generate a `config.json` file to save your settings.

The next time you open `autoscroll.exe`, it will remember the last window position.  
If you want to reset everything, simply delete the `config.json` file and restart the program.
